## Description
The OmniGrip is a master manipulator gripper device capable of rendering a programmed stiffness. This open source project aims to add a seventh degree of freedom to the conventional Sensable Touch (Phantom Omni) haptic device. The project's files can be found at our [github repository](https://github.com/michaellin/OmniGrip). There are two versions of the device. The RE model uses a [Maxon RE-25 Motor](http://www.engr.ucsb.edu/~mdnip/me170c/datasheets/25mm_Motors.pdf) and the A-Max model uses a [Maxon A-Max-22 Motor](http://www.farnell.com/datasheets/484760.pdf).
